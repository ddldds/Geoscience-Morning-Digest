    "summary": "<div>It is currently debated whether Earth system models (ESMs) can reproduce observation-based long-term changes in global and regional deoxygenation rates. Both models and observations include uncertainties, which must be considered when evaluating their consistency. Based on 14 ESMs and 6 observational datasets, the models&#8217; climatological annual mean oxygen matches observations well near the surface. However, significant biases remain in the tropics and in the thermocline. Based on the same set of models and three time-varying observation-based datasets, the models tend to underestimate deoxygenation trends from 1965 to 2014, except for the North Atlantic basin. However, the small number of observational datasets limits this conclusion. One dataset appears to significantly underestimate deoxygenation due to sparse data coverage. This review highlights the need for improvements in model process representations and the development of more observation-based, quality-controlled datasets to better constrain and interpret oxygen changes in the ocean.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Uncertainties of dissolved oxygen field in CMIP6 ESMs and observational reconstructions are quantified.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The ESMs can skillfully reproduce long-term average oxygen near the surface, but challenges remain in the thermocline and tropics.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The ESMs underestimates the deoxygenation trends except for the North Atlantic basin.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

However, predicting future changes in DTR under global warming remains challenging due to significant uncertainties in model projections. This study uncovers a significant link between historical DTR trends and future projections on both global and regional scales. Leveraging this relationship, we introduce a constraining framework to enhance the accuracy of regional climate projections. The mechanism is that the changes in DTR are primarily driven by external forces such as greenhouse gas emissions, rather than internal climate variability. Increasing greenhouse gases reduces cloud cover, which migrates DTR decline by enhancing daytime shortwave radiation and reducing nighttime longwave radiation. While this relationship is generally robust across seasons, it weakens at high latitudes in winter due to minimal solar radiation. Our findings contribute to reducing uncertainties in model projections, offering valuable insights into future changes in DTR and their implications for regional climate responses.",

In this study, we present geochemical data from vent fluids collected in 2024 at the Jøtul hydrothermal field on the northern Knipovich Ridge. We analyzed major elements, dissolved gases, and used thermodynamic modeling to study how the fluids react with surrounding rocks. The fluids contain extremely high levels of CH4, even higher than those in the Guaymas Basin, and show features typical of sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems, suggesting that organic matter in clastic sediments has been broken down by the hot fluids. In contrast, the fluids also have high H2 ( > 15 mM) and low H2S concentrations, which are common in vents hosted by ultramafic rocks and geological evidence suggests that the vent field sits on a detachment fault. Our thermodynamic modeling indicates that the high H2/H2S ratios could be explained by the breakdown of organic matter at around 400 °C, rather than by reactions with ultramafic rocks. These findings broaden our understanding of sediment-hosted vent systems and suggest that fluid-sediment interaction is a more important source of oceanic carbon and dissolved hydrogen than previously recognized.",

In a remarkable example of near-simultaneous scientific progress, three complementary studies published in Nature Communications1–3 have resolved the near-atomic resolution structure of the full extracellular domain of human CD163 complexed with HpHb, primarily utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The most significant and unified conclusion emerging from this trio of papers is that CD163’s scavenging activity is fundamentally dependent on its ability to form functional multimers.",

    "summary": "<div>Landscapes are shaped by the interaction of tectonics, climate, and rock erosion dynamics. Active incision in bedrock rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution because river incision cuts deep valleys and canyons into bedrock, transporting that material to the sea. This unburdens Earth's surface, allowing uplift of majestic mountain peaks in tectonically active settings. Bedrock-bound rivers, where the banks and bed are mostly bedrock, are hard points in the landscape that set the upstream base level of drainage basins and that must be vertically incised to lower landscape elevation and balance erosion against tectonic uplift. There are four distinct bedrock-bound channel morphologies that do not occur in alluvial channels&#8212;constriction-pool-widenings, rapids, overfalls, and waterfalls&#8212;each of which has a distinct flow structure. Our ability to predict bedrock-bound channel morphodynamics is nascent, but the discovery of mechanistic lateral bedrock erosion models, coupled with existing vertical incision models, allow prediction of bedrock river geometry and adjustments due to changes in water flux, sediment supply, and regional uplift.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupled lateral and vertical erosion models reveal that the geometry of bedrock rivers is dominantly controlled by sediment supply, not discharge.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupling observations of nonuniform flow structures and erosion models confirm that bedrock-bound channels are loci of intense erosion along a river's profile.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Prediction of the 3D shape of bedrock-bound rivers is possible by combining models for flow, sediment transport, and bedrock erosion.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Morphodynamic predictions are limited by poor understanding of nonuniform flow structures, flow resistance, and sediment transport in bedrock-bound channels.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

One of the most visible and disruptive outcomes is the explosive growth of Sargassum — a floating brown alga that has, since 2011, formed vast rafts stretching thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean. Once largely confined to the Sargasso Sea, where it provides habitat for fish, turtles, and eels, Sargassum now inundates coastlines from West Africa to the Caribbean Islands and Florida. In a new report in Nature Geoscience, Jung et al.1 have identified the source of nutrients fueling Sargassum blooms, which are increasing as a result of climate change.",

    "summary": "<div><p>The interplay between melt, crystals, andvolatile bubbles controls the physical properties of magmas in Earth's crust, the rate of phase separation, and, by extension, chemical differentiation. The mechanical processes that couple crystals, bubbles, and melt are nonlinear, and their expression in magmatic systems can vary greatly with the relative phase proportions in the magma. In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms. We start with an inventory of forces acting on a single crystal or volatile bubble in a silicate melt. We follow with a discussion of different upscaling strategies to simplify the description of the dynamics at greater scales, relevant to the evolution of magma reservoirs.We discuss recent progress in the development of models to study the internal dynamics of magma reservoirs, highlight current challenges, and propose possible paths for further progress.</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The mechanical interaction between the constituents (melt, crystals, and bubbles) at the scale of crystals controls the properties of magmas.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The choice of upscaling strategy is controlled by the processes that are considered.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Melt-crystal separation processes and their efficiency vary with the relative proportion of the phases involved.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Melt extraction by repacking is fast compared to compaction but stalls as the mush reaches the maximum packing.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>The burgeoning field of phylogenetic paleoecology combines paleoecological data with hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships to tease apart the roles that ecology and relatedness both play in the evolution and function of an organism. The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.</p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>Stratigraphers&#8217; recent vote to reject the Anthropocene as a geological epoch could have consequences beyond geology, as many other disciplines have adopted the term. This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers&#8217; negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers&#8217; rejection of the epoch.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines.

    "summary": "<div><p>Understanding the links between magmatic evolution and volcanic eruptions requires knowledge of the physical behavior of magmas stored and transported within Earth's crust. The mobility of magmas is fundamentally tied to their rheology and therefore the temperatures they experience during residence&#8212;their thermal history. We review petrological and other constraints on magma thermal histories that silicic magmas experience during crustal storage. We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time. The recognition of dominantly immobile but variable storage conditions allows us to move beyond a simple dichotomy and to ask more interesting questions about how these variations in magma storage occur and evolve.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Understanding the thermal conditions of crustal magma storage is critical to assessing magma mobility and the ability to erupt.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>We synthesize available information about thermal histories that magmas experience within a common conceptual framework.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Most silicic magmas spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, but variability exists over time and space within and between magma systems.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>We can advance our understanding most effectively by focusing on the controls on these variations and implications for magma evolution and eruption.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

I have also worked across several discipline boundaries, an activity I call scientific trespassing. My career has unfolded in such unexpected ways that, like anyone's life and like the history of our planet, it can only be seen as a most improbable journey. A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.</p></div>",

While thermodynamic data are available for many endmembers, there are significant gaps in both thermodynamic and associated structural constraints, especially for complex systems. The continuous evolution of high temperature calorimetry into oxidative drop solution calorimetry has facilitated the measurement of enthalpies of formation and mixing and surface energies involving nonoxides, including chalcogenides.

The kinetics of localized physical and chemical transitions brought about by the shock wave are responsive to this time history. Solid-state viscosity of the media is responsible for establishing the time history of a shock wave. In 2003, researcher H.

This review furthers Melosh's epic efforts. In pursuing both the nuclear ground shock data and supporting laboratory test data, it undertakes methods for determining and calculations of the viscosity of solid materials on the respective scales. Further, applicability of viscoelasticity in modeling the shock response on the scales of concern is demonstrated and applied. The review closes with a discussion of universal features of the shock wave viscous time history in solid materials.

For instance, dietary behavior does not necessarily reflect tooth morphology. As an additional challenge, some isotopic mammal tissues commonly used in modern ecology, such as collagen in bone or dentine or keratin from hair, hoof, or horn, do not generally preserve in fossil remains older than &#8764;200 kyr. In contrast, major constituents of bioapatite often retain their initial isotopic composition through fossilization processes. Recent analytical developments in mass spectrometry now allow, using small samples, for assessment of isotopic variability of major and trace elements such as calcium or zinc.

    "summary": "<div><p>The brevity of the instrumental record limits our knowledge of tropical cyclone activity on multidecadal to longer timescales and hampers our ability to diagnose climatic controls. Sedimentary archives containing event beds provide essential data on tropical cyclone activity over centuries and millennia. This review highlights the advantages and limitations of this approach and how these reconstructions have illuminated patterns of tropical cyclone activity and potential climate drivers over the last millennium. Key elements to developing high-quality reconstructions include confident attribution of event beds to tropical cyclones, assessing the potential role of other mechanisms, and evaluating the potential influence of geomorphic changes, sea-level variations, and sediment supply on a settings&#8217; susceptibility to event bed deposition. Millennium-long histories of severe tropical cyclone occurrence are now available from many locations in the western North Atlantic and western North Pacific, revealing clear regional shifts in activity likely related to intervals of large-scale ocean-atmosphere reorganization.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Prior to significant human influence in Earth's climate, natural climate variability dramatically altered patterns of tropical cyclone activity.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>For some regions (e.g., The Bahamas and the Marshall Islands), earlier intervals of tropical cyclone activity exceeded what humans have experienced during the recent period of instrumental measurements (&#8764;1850 CE&#8211;present).\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Risk assessments based on the short instrumental record likely underestimate the threat posed by tropical cyclones in many regions.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation associated with the Little Ice Age (&#8764;1400&#8211;1800 CE) resulted in significant regional changes in tropical cyclone activity.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Given the past sensitivity of tropical cyclone activity to climate change, we should anticipate regional shifts in tropical cyclone activity in response to ongoing anthropogenic warming of the planet.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>Methane (CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span>) is a simple molecule that, due to its radiative forcing, wields an outsized impact on planetary heat balance. Methane is formed by diverse abiotic pathways across a range of pressures and temperatures. Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration uses a terminal nickel-containing enzyme and is limited to the archaeal domain of life. Methane can also be produced in aerobic microbes during bacterial methylphosphonate and methylamine degradation and via nonenzymatic reactions during oxidative stress. Abiotic CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> is produced via thermogenic reactions and during serpentinization reactions in the presence of metal catalysts. Reconstructions of CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> cycling over geologic time are largely inferential. Throughout Earth's history, CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> has probably been the second most important climate-forcing greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Biological methanogenesis has likely dominated CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> flux to Earth's atmosphere for the past &#8764;3.5 billion years, during which time CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> is thought to have generally declined as atmospheric oxygen has risen.

    "summary": "<div><p>Intrinsic magnetic fields were once commonplace across our Solar System, and many planetary bodies have sustained active dynamos to the present day. The nature and behavior of these dynamos vary widely, however, reflecting the diverse internal conditions of planets as summarized in this review. For the terrestrial planets, the existence of active dynamos and/or ancient remanent magnetization recorded in crustal rocks, or lack thereof, lead to questions about their timing and power sources. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that many small bodies in the Solar System exhibit remanent magnetization, often attributed to ancient core dynamos with little known about the fluid dynamics. For the gas giants, their dipole-dominated magnetic fields and internal structures are relatively well-characterized, with dilute cores that are not centrally concentrated and other stable layers that likely affect the dynamo in ways that are not yet understood. For the ice giants, their multipolar magnetic fields and internal structures are unusual yet poorly constrained, to the extent that even the water-to-rock ratio is not well-known. Through adoption of a broader comparative planetology approach, the study of dynamos in exoplanets and cool stars enriches our understanding of dynamo theories.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Planetary dynamos exhibit diverse magnetic fields shaped by their distinct physical and chemical conditions.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The study of planets and stars connects planetary science, geophysics, and astrophysics, revealing shared dynamo processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>While significant progress has been made in understanding planetary and stellar magnetic fields, many puzzles still persist.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

The magnetic properties of rocks and sediments are assumed to be stable and largely attributable to inorganic processes. This conventional view overlooks mounting evidence of microorganisms as key players in rock transformations and geological processes. Iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitous in most environments and are commonly used by microorganisms as electron donors and acceptors. Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties by creating, altering, and dissolving Fe-bearing minerals, potentially modifying the original magnetization, complicating interpretations of the magnetic record. This review provides an overview of biogenic pathways that modulate magnetic minerals and discusses common, yet underutilized, magnetic methods for capturing such behavior. Appreciating the influence of microbial activities on magnetic properties will improve our interpretations of Earth's geologic past and its elemental cycling.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties, challenging traditional views of a geologically stable magnetic record formed solely by inorganic processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial iron cycling modulates magnetic properties modifying magnetic information recorded in rocks.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial processes may have impacted Earth's magnetic history more deeply than previously understood.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Recognizing microbial contributions is critical for accurate interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records and could aid in the search for life on other planetary bodies.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

This article describes this hierarchy of climate sensitivities and associated modeling approaches.

    "summary": "<div><p>The emergence of continental crust above sea level influences Earth's surface environments and climate patterns, and it creates diverse habitats that promote biodiversity. Earth exhibits bimodal hypsometry with elevated continents and a submerged seafloor. However, it remains elusive when and how this unique feature was first established. The geological record suggests the presence of subaerial landmasses between ca.&#160;3.8 and 2.4&#160;billion years ago (Ga), but their spatial extent and longevity remain unclear. Further, the tectonic processes governing the proportion of continental land to ocean basins and topography during this period are poorly understood. Here, we synthesize a variety of geological and geochemical proxies to suggest that crustal emergence did occur in the early-to-mid Archean, primarily exposing precratonized volcanic crust for brief time periods. Stable continental crust on a regional scale (as cratons) began emerging around ca.&#160;3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga, facilitated by the development of thick, stable cratonic lithospheres. Over hundreds of millions of years, voluminous magmatism within a plateau-type setting led to the formation of thick, felsic crust and depleted mantle keels, allowing cratons to rise above sea level via isostatic adjustment. The areal extent of emergent land increased from ca.&#160;3.0 to 2.5&#160;Ga owing to the formation of more cratons, likely coinciding with the onset of plate tectonics, and culminated around ca.&#160;2.5&#8211;2.2&#160;Ga when land surface area and freeboard conditions resembled those observed today. These newly emerged landmasses possibly played a critical role in oxygenating the atmosphere and oceans, cooling the climate, and promoting biodiversity during the late Archean to early Paleoproterozoic.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Continental emergence marks a pivotal moment in Earth's history, impacting the planet's atmosphere, oceans, climate, and life evolution.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>We review the rock record to infer the timing, nature, and tectonic drivers of continental emergence on early Earth.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergence on early Archean Earth was mostly transient, exposing primarily volcanic crust.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The first stable continental land formed at ca. 3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga due to the development of thick cratons and their isostatic adjustment.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergent land area increased from ca. 3.0 to 2.5 Ga as more felsic crust formed and plate tectonics began.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",
