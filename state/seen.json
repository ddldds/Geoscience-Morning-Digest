In this study, we present geochemical data from vent fluids collected in 2024 at the Jøtul hydrothermal field on the northern Knipovich Ridge. We analyzed major elements, dissolved gases, and used thermodynamic modeling to study how the fluids react with surrounding rocks. The fluids contain extremely high levels of CH4, even higher than those in the Guaymas Basin, and show features typical of sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems, suggesting that organic matter in clastic sediments has been broken down by the hot fluids. In contrast, the fluids also have high H2 ( > 15 mM) and low H2S concentrations, which are common in vents hosted by ultramafic rocks and geological evidence suggests that the vent field sits on a detachment fault. Our thermodynamic modeling indicates that the high H2/H2S ratios could be explained by the breakdown of organic matter at around 400 °C, rather than by reactions with ultramafic rocks. These findings broaden our understanding of sediment-hosted vent systems and suggest that fluid-sediment interaction is a more important source of oceanic carbon and dissolved hydrogen than previously recognized.",

In a remarkable example of near-simultaneous scientific progress, three complementary studies published in Nature Communications1–3 have resolved the near-atomic resolution structure of the full extracellular domain of human CD163 complexed with HpHb, primarily utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The most significant and unified conclusion emerging from this trio of papers is that CD163’s scavenging activity is fundamentally dependent on its ability to form functional multimers.",

    "summary": "<div>Landscapes are shaped by the interaction of tectonics, climate, and rock erosion dynamics. Active incision in bedrock rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution because river incision cuts deep valleys and canyons into bedrock, transporting that material to the sea. This unburdens Earth's surface, allowing uplift of majestic mountain peaks in tectonically active settings. Bedrock-bound rivers, where the banks and bed are mostly bedrock, are hard points in the landscape that set the upstream base level of drainage basins and that must be vertically incised to lower landscape elevation and balance erosion against tectonic uplift. There are four distinct bedrock-bound channel morphologies that do not occur in alluvial channels&#8212;constriction-pool-widenings, rapids, overfalls, and waterfalls&#8212;each of which has a distinct flow structure. Our ability to predict bedrock-bound channel morphodynamics is nascent, but the discovery of mechanistic lateral bedrock erosion models, coupled with existing vertical incision models, allow prediction of bedrock river geometry and adjustments due to changes in water flux, sediment supply, and regional uplift.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupled lateral and vertical erosion models reveal that the geometry of bedrock rivers is dominantly controlled by sediment supply, not discharge.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupling observations of nonuniform flow structures and erosion models confirm that bedrock-bound channels are loci of intense erosion along a river's profile.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Prediction of the 3D shape of bedrock-bound rivers is possible by combining models for flow, sediment transport, and bedrock erosion.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Morphodynamic predictions are limited by poor understanding of nonuniform flow structures, flow resistance, and sediment transport in bedrock-bound channels.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

One of the most visible and disruptive outcomes is the explosive growth of Sargassum — a floating brown alga that has, since 2011, formed vast rafts stretching thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic Ocean. Once largely confined to the Sargasso Sea, where it provides habitat for fish, turtles, and eels, Sargassum now inundates coastlines from West Africa to the Caribbean Islands and Florida. In a new report in Nature Geoscience, Jung et al.1 have identified the source of nutrients fueling Sargassum blooms, which are increasing as a result of climate change.",

In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms. We start with an inventory of forces acting on a single crystal or volatile bubble in a silicate melt.

    "summary": "<div><p>The burgeoning field of phylogenetic paleoecology combines paleoecological data with hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships to tease apart the roles that ecology and relatedness both play in the evolution and function of an organism. The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.</p></div>",

This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers&#8217; negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers&#8217; rejection of the epoch.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines.

The mobility of magmas is fundamentally tied to their rheology and therefore the temperatures they experience during residence&#8212;their thermal history. We review petrological and other constraints on magma thermal histories that silicic magmas experience during crustal storage. We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time.

A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.</p></div>",

While thermodynamic data are available for many endmembers, there are significant gaps in both thermodynamic and associated structural constraints, especially for complex systems. The continuous evolution of high temperature calorimetry into oxidative drop solution calorimetry has facilitated the measurement of enthalpies of formation and mixing and surface energies involving nonoxides, including chalcogenides.

The kinetics of localized physical and chemical transitions brought about by the shock wave are responsive to this time history. Solid-state viscosity of the media is responsible for establishing the time history of a shock wave. In 2003, researcher H. Jay Melosh recognized the need for an understanding of solid viscosity spanning the petrologic and lithologic scales, and accordingly, he undertook the assessment and analysis of available nuclear ground shock measurements. This review furthers Melosh's epic efforts. In pursuing both the nuclear ground shock data and supporting laboratory test data, it undertakes methods for determining and calculations of the viscosity of solid materials on the respective scales. Further, applicability of viscoelasticity in modeling the shock response on the scales of concern is demonstrated and applied.

In Japan, almost all the documents are written in kuzushiji (old-style Japanese cursive script), a writing style used before &#8764;1900. Because the style of writing is different from modern Japanese, transcription is necessary to use the historical documents as data for earthquake research. The workspace of Minna de Honkoku consists of a viewer of a document image and a vertical (Japanese-style) editor for transcription. Users can input transcribed text while viewing its image. The ranking of characters transcribed is displayed to keep users motivated. As of October&#160;2024, more than 9,700 people were registered for the project, with the total number of characters transcribed at about 41 million. The text generated by Minna de Honkoku can be used for various academic research fields including seismology and can be used to enhance citizens&#8217; disaster awareness. The paired kuzushiji characters and text data generated by Minna de Honkoku are beginning to be used as training data for artificial intelligence.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Minna de Honkoku is an online citizen science project aimed at deciphering historical documents.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The total number of participants is 9,700, and characters transcribed by Minna de Honkoku reaches 41 million.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Minna de Honkoku began as a project to transcribe earthquake-related historical materials.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The text generated by Minna de Honkoku is used in seismology and various research fields and for building artificial intelligence&#8211;based kuzushiji recognition.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

But inferring such important traits (e.g., trophic position, metabolism, pathologies) in extinct animals, including humans, can be challenging because biological processes rarely mirror morphology as preserved in the fossil record. For instance, dietary behavior does not necessarily reflect tooth morphology. As an additional challenge, some isotopic mammal tissues commonly used in modern ecology, such as collagen in bone or dentine or keratin from hair, hoof, or horn, do not generally preserve in fossil remains older than &#8764;200 kyr. In contrast, major constituents of bioapatite often retain their initial isotopic composition through fossilization processes. Recent analytical developments in mass spectrometry now allow, using small samples, for assessment of isotopic variability of major and trace elements such as calcium or zinc.

Copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements are particularly in demand for batteries and high-performance magnets used in low-carbon technologies.

Nickel, which comes from laterite and magmatic sulfide deposits, and cobalt, often a by-product of nickel or copper mining, are core components of batteries that power electric vehicles. Lithium, sourced from pegmatite deposits and continental brines, is another key battery component. Rare earth elements, primarily obtained from carbonatite- and regolith-hosted ion-adsorption deposits, have unique magnetic properties that are key for motor efficiency. Future demand for these elements is expected to increase significantly over the next decades, potentially outpacing expected mine production.

Methane can also be produced in aerobic microbes during bacterial methylphosphonate and methylamine degradation and via nonenzymatic reactions during oxidative stress.

Paleomagnetic studies reveal that many small bodies in the Solar System exhibit remanent magnetization, often attributed to ancient core dynamos with little known about the fluid dynamics. For the gas giants, their dipole-dominated magnetic fields and internal structures are relatively well-characterized, with dilute cores that are not centrally concentrated and other stable layers that likely affect the dynamo in ways that are not yet understood. For the ice giants, their multipolar magnetic fields and internal structures are unusual yet poorly constrained, to the extent that even the water-to-rock ratio is not well-known.

Research and exploration over the past 30 years have revealed some of the diversity of seafloor eruptions and their impact on the undersea environment.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Submarine eruptions are simultaneously the most common and the least observed form of volcanism on Earth.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Hydrostatic pressure at the vent depth modulates explosive versus effusive eruption and the form of eruptive behavior.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Submarine eruptions have significant impacts on marine biological communities and chemical fluxes to the ocean.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Resilience of fauna to eruption events is also variable, and recovery dynamics can be slow with many years or decades required for communities to reform.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>Field experiences are highly valued in geoscience education. However, logistical, financial, and accessibility challenges associated with fieldwork and rapid advancements in technology have all prompted geoscience educators to explore virtual field experiences (VFEs) as alternatives. Rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of VFEs has not kept pace with their implementation, but recent studies offer meaningful and actionable findings that can inform ongoing and future use of VFEs in geoscience education. We present a review of selected studies that address three significant aspects of this still-evolving modality. First, we examine current characterization and classification of VFEs. Second, we examine studies that evaluate the effectiveness of teaching with VFEs. Third, we extend this review to studies that compare VFEs with in-person field experiences (IPFEs). The studies we review demonstrate that VFEs are a valuable approach to teaching introductory geoscience content, even compared to IPFEs.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Challenges associated with field geoscience education and improvements in technology have led geoscience educators to develop and implement virtual field experiences (VFEs) as teaching tools.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>VFEs are tested, practical, and effective alternatives to in-person field experiences in introductory geoscience education.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",

    "summary": "<div><p>The emergence of continental crust above sea level influences Earth's surface environments and climate patterns, and it creates diverse habitats that promote biodiversity. Earth exhibits bimodal hypsometry with elevated continents and a submerged seafloor. However, it remains elusive when and how this unique feature was first established. The geological record suggests the presence of subaerial landmasses between ca.&#160;3.8 and 2.4&#160;billion years ago (Ga), but their spatial extent and longevity remain unclear. Further, the tectonic processes governing the proportion of continental land to ocean basins and topography during this period are poorly understood. Here, we synthesize a variety of geological and geochemical proxies to suggest that crustal emergence did occur in the early-to-mid Archean, primarily exposing precratonized volcanic crust for brief time periods. Stable continental crust on a regional scale (as cratons) began emerging around ca.&#160;3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga, facilitated by the development of thick, stable cratonic lithospheres. Over hundreds of millions of years, voluminous magmatism within a plateau-type setting led to the formation of thick, felsic crust and depleted mantle keels, allowing cratons to rise above sea level via isostatic adjustment. The areal extent of emergent land increased from ca.&#160;3.0 to 2.5&#160;Ga owing to the formation of more cratons, likely coinciding with the onset of plate tectonics, and culminated around ca.&#160;2.5&#8211;2.2&#160;Ga when land surface area and freeboard conditions resembled those observed today. These newly emerged landmasses possibly played a critical role in oxygenating the atmosphere and oceans, cooling the climate, and promoting biodiversity during the late Archean to early Paleoproterozoic.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Continental emergence marks a pivotal moment in Earth's history, impacting the planet's atmosphere, oceans, climate, and life evolution.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>We review the rock record to infer the timing, nature, and tectonic drivers of continental emergence on early Earth.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergence on early Archean Earth was mostly transient, exposing primarily volcanic crust.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The first stable continental land formed at ca. 3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga due to the development of thick cratons and their isostatic adjustment.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Emergent land area increased from ca. 3.0 to 2.5 Ga as more felsic crust formed and plate tectonics began.\n</li>\n</ul></p></div>",
